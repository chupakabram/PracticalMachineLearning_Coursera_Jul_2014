Practical Machine Learning - course project files:

    PML_CP_RF.Rmd   - creates calssificator using the 'caret' package and 'Random Forest' method
    PML_CP_RF.html  - result of the 'PML_CP_RF.Rmd' execution

The accuracy of calssification is 100%. 

Just for compare resulst ( and for fun ):

    PML_CP_NNet.Rmd  - creates the neural network calssificator using the 'nnet'
    PML_CP_NNet.html - result of the 'PML_CP_NNet.Rmd' execution

Accuracy of the Neural net is not so high (
