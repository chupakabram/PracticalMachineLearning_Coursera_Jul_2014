Practical Machine Learning - course project files:

    PML_CP_RF.Rmd   - creates calssificator using the 'caret' package and 'Random Forest' method
    PML_CP_RF.html  - result of the 'PML_CP_RF.Rmd' execution

Prediction result is : B A B A A E D B A A B C B A E E A B B B

The accuracy of calssification is 100% - according to the submission feedback.

Just for compare resulst ( and for fun ):

    PML_CP_NNet.Rmd  - creates the neural network calssificator using the 'nnet' package
    PML_CP_NNet.html - result of the 'PML_CP_NNet.Rmd' execution

Prediction result is : C A B A A C D B A A D C D A E E A D B B

Accuracy of the Neural net is not so high - 75 % only (
